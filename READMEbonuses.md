The following list is the extra things we added to the website:
    <ol>
    <li>Manager system: We allowed for superusers to create, update and delete products from the catalog. Our thought was that it would be a manager system for employees.</li>
    <li>We added a cart functionality, where people can add many items to their cart which allow for them to purchase many items at once.</li>
    <li>We made an About Site with information about the company. </li>
    <li>We added a print receipt button on the confirmation page which allows the user to get information about their purchase in a printable fashion.</li>
    <li>We made extra effort in the css for a cooler website</li>
